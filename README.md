Hey this is my react reminder app I made using the following tutorial \
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

## This is deployed here
https://react-task-tracker-basseybd.vercel.app/

## Mics notes
Has bugs in the where the tasks are not rendering when deployed this is a low proioty project I will likely get to it eventually but not anytime soon I think it was running off a local server but I will crosscheck when I get the chance

### Take aways!
Learnt about props, useStates, useEffects \
Learnt about routering \
Making API calls to backend json servers \
React in general tons of fun
